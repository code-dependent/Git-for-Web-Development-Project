Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
 INLINE elements do not contain width, height, margin-top/bottom or padding-top/bottom therefor those css properties cant be applied to them.
BLOCK elements do contain those properties and by default take up the entire width of the webpage.
this causes them to behave differently. EXAMPLE

<span>some text</span>
<span>some text</span>
<span>some text</span>

the output would be 
// 
some textsome textsome text 
// 
this is because the span element, by default, is display:inline; if i were to change it to display:block; the output would be
//
some text
some text
some text
//

    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
it will jump out of the "flow" of the webpage. EXAMPLE
//CSS
<style>
.abs{
  width:50px;
  height:50px;
  background:purple;
  position:absolute;
}
</style>
\\HTML
<div>
  <p>Ipsum</p>
  <div class="abs"></div>
  <p>Lorem</p>
</div>
\\OUTPUT
over lapping would occur unless positon:relative; is used on the p:nth-child(2). even though the red <div> is placed between the two <p> elements, it gets ignored and will cause <p>Lorem</p> to be hidden behind it if it lacks positon:relative;.
if the bottom, top, left or right properties are modified in the css, the red <div> will look for an ancestor element that has the css position propertie of position:relative; to base its left,right,top and bottom calculations on. if none is found the red <div> will base its calculations on the <body>.

    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
display:inline-block;


    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default

<div>block</div>
<p>block</p>
<h1-6>block</h1-6>

<a href="#">inline</a>
<br>inline

<input>inline


    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the fix for the box model? 
every element in html is being rendered into some sort of box/rectangle. the box model is that element's margin, border, padding and content. 

box-sizing:border-box;
